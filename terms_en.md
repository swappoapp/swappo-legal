**Last Updated:** 20/12/2025

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Swappo**. By accessing or using our mobile application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not use the Service.

These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and the developers, **Lorenzo Concina & Michelangelo Concina** ("we," "us," or "our").

## 2. Nature of the Service
Swappo is a peer-to-peer platform that allows users to exchange second-hand items using a virtual token system.

* **Platform Only:** We act solely as a technical venue. We are **not** a party to any transaction, swap, or agreement between users.
* **No Guarantee:** We do not verify, endorse, or guarantee the quality, safety, legality, authenticity, or existence of any products exchanged, nor the truth or accuracy of user listings or reviews.
* **Physical Exchanges:** You acknowledge that Swappo does not supervise physical meetings between users. Any face-to-face meeting is at your sole risk and discretion.

## 3. User Accounts
* **Registration:** You must provide accurate and complete information (Name, Email, Phone) during the sign-up process.
* **Security:** You are strictly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
* **Age Requirement:** You must be at least **18 years old** to use this Service. By using Swappo, you warrant that you are of legal age.

## 4. The Token System
* **Virtual Currency:** The "Tokens" (`tokenBalance`) used in Swappo are virtual credits solely for use within the application to facilitate exchanges.
* **No Monetary Value:** Tokens have **zero real-world monetary value**. They cannot be exchanged for fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.), cannot be withdrawn to a bank account, and are not an investment vehicle.
* **Adjustments:** We reserve the right to modify, revoke, or adjust token balances at our sole discretion in cases of suspected bug exploitation, fraud, or system errors.

## 5. User Conduct & Content
You agree **NOT** to upload, list, or exchange:
* Illegal items (e.g., drugs, weapons, stolen goods).
* Counterfeit or pirated items.
* Sexual, pornographic, or explicitly adult content.
* Hate speech, harassment, or bullying content.

**Content License:** By uploading images and descriptions, you grant Swappo a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and reproduce this content within the app to facilitate the service. We reserve the right to remove any content without prior notice if it violates these Terms.

## 6. Limitation of Liability (READ CAREFULLY)
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Swappo and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation:

1.  **Transaction Disputes:** Any dispute arising between users regarding the quality, delivery, or fairness of a swap.
2.  **Physical Safety:** Any personal injury, theft, or property damage resulting from meeting another user in person to exchange items.
3.  **Item Condition:** Items that are damaged, not as described, or lost during shipping/handover.
4.  **Service Availability:** Any loss of data or tokens resulting from server downtime, bugs, or unauthorized access to your account.

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis without warranties of any kind.

## 7. Release
In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Swappo (and its officers, directors, developers, agents, and employees) from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

## 8. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Swappo and its developers from and against any claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from:
* Your use of and access to the Service;
* Your violation of any term of these Terms;
* Your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right.

## 9. Account Termination
We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service (and any accumulated Tokens) will cease immediately.

## 10. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of **Italy**, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
