        <h1>SWAPPO TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 04/01/2026</p>
        <p>Welcome to Swappo. These General Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the access to and use of the Swappo application ("Service" or "App") by its users.</p>

        <h2>1. Content of the Service</h2>
        <p>Swappo provides a platform that allows its users to post listings to exchange items. The Service enables users to connect with each other to conduct exchanges based on a system of in-App digital tokens with no economic value. All relationships, including exchanges and the delivery of goods, occur exclusively between users. Swappo is not a party to these relationships and does not assume any role as a mediator or guarantor.</p>

        <h2>2. Platform Ownership</h2>
        <p>Lorenzo Concina and Michelangelo Concina are the sole owners of the Swappo platform and all rights related to and resulting from its operation.</p>

        <h2>3. Applicability and Terms of Use</h2>
        <p>These Terms apply to all users of the Service. Use of the Service is permitted only for users of legal age (over 18 years old). By using the App, you represent that you are of legal age and fully accept these Terms.</p>

        <h2>4. User Responsibility</h2>
        <p>The user is fully and exclusively responsible for the use of the Service, with particular regard to the content of published listings, the accuracy of the information provided, and their conduct during interactions with other users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user guarantees the full availability and/or ownership of the goods offered in the listings.</li>
            <li>The user guarantees that their listings and the items described therein do not violate any applicable laws, third-party rights (including copyright and industrial property rights), and do not involve prohibited goods.</li>
            <li>The user agrees not to misuse contacts found on the platform, for example, by sending advertising, spam, or other unsolicited communications.</li>
            <li>In the event of a dispute by a third party regarding a listing or related conduct, the user assumes full responsibility and agrees to indemnify and hold Swappo (and its owners) harmless from any damage, loss, or expense.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. License to User Content</h2>
        <p>By posting content on Swappo (including text, photographs, videos, etc.), the user grants Swappo a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, and display such content within the App and for promotional purposes of the Service itself. The user warrants that they have the right to grant such a license.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Swappo makes no warranty as to the content, completeness, or accuracy of the listings, nor as to the quality or legality of the items exchanged. Swappo is not a party to the negotiations and exchanges between users and does not guarantee a successful outcome. Consequently, no request for returns, compensation, repairs, or refunds may be directed at Swappo.</p>
        <p>Swappo reserves the right to remove any listing or content that, in its sole discretion, violates these Terms or the law, without any prior notice.</p>

        <h2>7. Suspension and Termination of Service</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate a user's access to the Service for violating these Terms, for instance, in cases of fraud, posting of illegal content, harassment, or other misconduct. In serious cases, the account may be permanently deleted.</p>
        <p>We also reserve the right to modify, suspend, or permanently terminate the Service in its entirety. In such a case, we will endeavor to provide at least 30 (thirty) days' notice to users via email or an in-app notification to allow for the completion of ongoing exchanges.</p>

        <h2>8. User Ratings</h2>
        <p>Users may have the ability to leave each other a rating after an exchange. Ratings must be truthful and respectful. Swappo reserves the right to remove ratings that are offensive, false, or irrelevant, at its sole discretion.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. In the event of substantial changes, we will notify the user by prominently posting them on the App or through other means of communication. Continued use of the Service after such changes will constitute acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>The relationship between Swappo and its users is governed by Italian law. Except as provided by non-derogable legal provisions, any dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Trento.</p>
