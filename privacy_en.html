        <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 20/12/2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>Swappo</strong>. By accessing or using our mobile application, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you may not use the Service.</p>

            <li><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> We do not verify, endorse, or guarantee the quality, safety, legality, authenticity, or existence of any products exchanged, nor the truth or accuracy of user listings or reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Exchanges:</strong> You acknowledge that Swappo does not supervise physical meetings between users. Any face-to-face meeting is at your sole risk and discretion.</li>

            <li><strong>No Monetary Value:</strong> Tokens have <strong>zero real-world monetary value</strong>. They cannot be exchanged for fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.), cannot be withdrawn to a bank account, and are not an investment vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> We reserve the right to modify, revoke, or adjust token balances at our sole discretion in cases of suspected bug exploitation, fraud, or system errors.</li>
        </ul>
